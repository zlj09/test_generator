Setup
    This program require Python 3.0 or higher version (tested under Python 3.7.0 32 bit). Please install Python 3 before run this program.


Run
    The main program is logic_simulator.py. Simply run "python logic_simulator.py" in command-line interface and then you will see the simulation results for the 4 given circuits: s27, s298f_2, s344f_2, s249f_2.

    Additional Tests
    If you need to do some additional tests, please follow the instructions below:
    1. Prepare a netlist file defining the circuit, whose location is netlist_path
    2. Prepare a input file listing the input vectors line by line, whose location is input_file_path
    3. Define a the output file location output_file_path
    4. Run "python logic_simulator.py netlist_path input_file_path output_file_path"
    5. The results will be printed on screen as well as the specified output file
    
    For example:
        Command:
            python logic_simulator.py circuits\and_or.txt inputs\and_or_inputs.txt outputs\and_or_outputs.txt
        Results:
            Netlist Path: circuits\and_or.txt
            Input File Path: inputs\and_or_inputs.txt
            Output File Path: outputs\and_or_outputs.txt
            Inputs:
            000
            001
            010
            011
            100
            101
            110
            111
            Outputs:
            0
            1
            0
            1
            0
            1
            1
            1


Output
    The output file lists the output vectors corresponding to the input vectors line by line. The order of bits in a output vector is determined by the order of output wires listing in the netlist file.
