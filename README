Setup
    This program require Python 3.0 or higher version (tested under Python 3.7.0 32 bit). Please install Python 3 before run this program.


Run
    The main program is logic_simulator.py. Simply run "python logic_simulator.py" in command-line interface and then you will see the simulation results for the four given circuits: s27, s298f_2, s344f_2, s249f_2.

    Additional Tests
    If you need to do some additional tests, please follow the instructions below:
    1. Prepare a netlist file defining the circuit, whose location is netlist_path
    2. Prepare a input file listing the input vectors line by line, whose location is input_file_path
    3. Define a the output file location output_file_path
    4. Enter Python shell, then import logic_simulator
    5. Run logic_simulator.run(netlist_path input_file_path, output_file_path)
    6. The program will print the results both in the screen and the output file


Output
    The output file lists the output vectors corresponding to the input vectors line by line. The order of bits in a output vector is determined by the order of output wires listing in the netlist file.
